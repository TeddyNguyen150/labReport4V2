Step 4:

ssh<space>ten001<shift+2>ieng6.ucsd.edu<enter>
  This was just to log into my ieng6.

Step 5:

cse15lsp24<enter>
  Goes into the cse15lsp24 directory.
git<space>clone<ctrl+v><enter>
  ctrl+v paste the copied url and the command copies the lab7 fork into the remote.

cd<space>l<tab><enter>
  Since I know lab7 is the only thing that starts with l, I used tab to autofill it.

bash<space>t<tab><enter>
  test.sh is the only thing that starts with a t, so I can auto fill it with tab and run it to start the tests.

Step 7:
![image](https://github.com/TeddyNguyen150/labReport4V2/assets/156158048/5a7ebb60-ac68-4690-857b-dd9cc5702d9a)
vim<space><shift+l><tab>.j<tab><enter>
  Using tab again to auto fill in order to get to ListExamples.java faster.

44<shift+g><enter>er2<shift+;>wq<enter>
  44G goes to line 44, where the error is, e goes to the end of the word, index1, r enters replacement mode, and 2 replaces
  1 from index1 to a 2 which becomes index2. Then :wq exits and saves the file.


Step 8:

<up><up><enter>
  bash test.sh was already a previously used command so <up><up><enter> goes back and reruns the command.

Step 9:
![image](https://github.com/TeddyNguyen150/labReport4V2/assets/156158048/9832da39-9a2d-4831-9a8a-81651bda5c69)
git<space>add<space><shift+l><tab><enter>
  It autocompletes ListExamples.java for me to add.

git<space>commit<enter>itest<shift+;>wq<enter>
  after typing out git commit, I wrote test as my message and exited and saved the message with :wq.

git<space>push<enter>
  pushes all the changes verified by git commit,
I put in my info to continue to push the changes.
